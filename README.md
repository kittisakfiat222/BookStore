```

---

## üîë Authorization (JWT)

1. Generate a JWT token (via `/user/login` or `JwtService`)  
2. In Swagger UI, click the **Authorize** button (top-right)  
3. Enter your token:
   ```
   Bearer {your_jwt_token}
   ```
4. Now you can test secured endpoints like `/user/like`

---

## üìñ Example: Like a Book

**Request**
```http
POST /user/like
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "User_Id": 1,
  "Book_Id": "9781234567890"
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "message": "liked"
}
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Do **not** expose your real JWT Key in production Swagger descriptions  
- The `/user/like` endpoint requires a valid token  
- The token is always passed in the `Authorization` header
